# Tools

At source{d} we try to use tools that are as simple as possible. If you can think of any tools that are simpler, better or cheaper please let us know! Here we will give instructions on how to make the best use of the tools we currently use.

You can also check our [communication guide](../communication/README.md) for more details on our communication tools.

These are the tools that every sourcerer uses:
* [Github](https://github.com)
