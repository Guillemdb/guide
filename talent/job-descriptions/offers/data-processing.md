### [Company](../company-section.md)

### [Engineering at source{d}](../engineering-section.md)

### Role

The Data Processing team is developing source{d}'s high-level code analysis applications for running scalable processing pipelines for source code analysis. Written mostly in Go, with some Scala components, it aims to be robust, friendly, flexible and capable of running on large-scale distributed clusters over petabytes of data.

The team projects are:

* [go-mysql-server](https://github.com/src-d/go-mysql-server/): a SQL engine with a MySQL interface, written in Go.
* [gitbase](https://github.com/src-d/gitbase): a SQL interface to Git repositories, written in Go.
* [gitbase-spark-connector](https://github.com/src-d/gitbase-spark-connector) gitbase connector for Apache Spark, written in Scala.

You will be expected to have strong backend coding skills in at least two languages, and very good algorithmic problem-solving skills. Skill at programming in Scala and Go, and knowledge about Apache Spark, are not required but will be highly appreciated. For Go in particular we strongly believe it can be learned by any skilled developer, and we care much more about our team's mindset and prior experience than specific language skills.

Good knowledge of distributed systems and parallel processing is important. Previous experience with SQL engines or similar systems is a plus.
