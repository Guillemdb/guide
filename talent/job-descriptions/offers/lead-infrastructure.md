### Role 

This position is for a Lead Engineer in the Infrastructure team. The team has currently 3 members.

The Infrastructure team manages multiple clusters:

- Pipeline clusters, built on bare metal servers at a hosting provider. It has more than 1000 threads, more than 6TB of RAM and 500TB of storage, and it is backed by CoreOS and Kubernetes. It has two main goals: on the one hand, it stores all the available public code in a distributed filesystem and on the other hand, it runs intensive computation jobs over the stored data on top of Apache Spark.

- Machine Learning research cluster, built on bare metal servers at our Madrid office. It is backed by CoreOS and Kubernetes too and it has GPUs available on every server to run deep learning algorithms. 

- Multiple Google Kubernetes Engine clusters for public-facing services.

All clusters are managed with Terraform, Kubernetes and Helm.

The team also maintains several services such as databases, queues, continuous integration, monitoring, logging, etc.

At source{d}, we care about Open Source, which is why we as the infrastructure team we contribute to projects such as Terraform & CoreOS and create our own. We maintain the official Terraform provider for Helm ([terraform-provider-helm](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-helm)).

We are looking for someone with background on Linux, networking and containers, passion for automation and experience working at scale. Finally, knowledge of at least one backend/scripting language who cares about best development practices.
