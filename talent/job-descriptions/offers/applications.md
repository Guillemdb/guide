### Role

This position is for a Senior Engineer in the Applications team.

- As an Applications team engineer you will have a two-fold role: on one hand it's a Data Engineering, building production-level pipelines to collect and extract data from all the git repositories in the world. On the other hand, building web applications to productionize Machine Learning research on both, backend and frontend sides.

- You will be expected to have strong backend coding skills in at least two languages, and very good algorithmic problem-solving skills. Programming in Go, JavaScript, and Scala, and knowledge about single-page applications, are not required but will be highly appreciated. For Go in particular we strongly believe it can be learned by any skilled developer, and we care much more about our team's mindset and prior experience than specific language skills.

- Building tools for day to day use by software engineers requires good understanding of modern development processes and approaches: Unit/Integration testing, scrum, code reviews, CI/CD, Containers, etc.

- As you will be working closely with the Machine Learning team - strong communication skills and interest in Machine Learning, data process, and visualization are more than welcome.

Some of the projects the Application Team maintains are:

- [engine](https://github.com/src-d/engine/): a simple interface to our Code as Data stack based on Docker.
- [lookout](https://github.com/src-d/lookout/): a platform for Assisted Code Review.
- [gemini](https://github.com/src-d/gemini/): duplicated code detection at scale.
- [gitbase-web](https://github.com/src-d/gitbase-web) and [bblfsh/web](https://github.com/bblfsh/web): web interfaces for some of our projects.
