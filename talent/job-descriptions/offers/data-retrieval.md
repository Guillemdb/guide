### [Engineering at source{d}](../engineering-section.md)

### Role

The Data Retrieval team is developing source{d}'s data retrieval pipelines that synchronize and provide access to any number of code repositories. Written mostly in Go, it aims to be robust, friendly, flexible and capable of running on large-scale distributed clusters over petabytes of data.

We at source{d} seek to be at the heart of any project related to source code. Thus, this core tool is used both in-house for building source{d}'s unique global scale open dataset of +60M code repositories for cutting-edge Machine Learning research, as well as used by our customers to ingest git repositories to their source code processing clusters.

Good knowledge of Linux, storage, networking and distributed computing is important.

You will be expected to have strong backend coding skills in at least two languages, and very good algorithmic problem-solving skills. Skill at programming in Go is not required but will be highly appreciated. We strongly believe it can be learned by any skilled developer, and we care much more about our team's mindset and prior experience than specific language skills.
