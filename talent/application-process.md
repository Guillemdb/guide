# Applying at source{d}

This document describes the source{d} hiring process from the point of view of the candidate.

### Visiting our careers page

- All the open roles can be found at https://sourced.tech/company/#careers where the candidate is able to apply to any desired role.

- If there isn't a role that fits but the candidate is interested in working with us, they can send an email to talent@sourced.tech with their CV ( or GitHub account for developers) and a small intro of themselves.

### Screening

- Within a week after the submission of the application, the candidate should receive an email with an update. There may occasionally be delays. In any case, the candidate is free to reach out to us at any time via talent@sourced.tech.

- In the case of positive feedback in the application, the candidate is invited to a quick video call with the Talent Acquisition Manager.

### Initial interview: 1st stage

- The candidate has an introductory video call with the Talent Acquisition Manager. This is a general discussion that can last between 15-30 minutes. This is to allow us to get to know the background and experience of the candidate, as well as allowing them to get to know source{d} better. It's expected that the candidate will have already done some basic research about source{d} and has some specific questions about the role and/or the company to be expressed during the call. 

- There are notable exceptions to this, such as higher volume junior engineering roles where we directly ask the developer to do the coding challenge before a call.


### Hiring Manager interview: 2nd stage

- After the initial interview, the Talent Acquisition Manager will share a summary of the call with the Hiring Manager, and will discuss the suitability of the candidate to the role.

- The Talent Acquisition Manager will contact the candidate to organise the next interview with the hiring manager, or explain why we won't be moving forward with their application

- The Hiring Manager interview will last around one hour via video call, and will be a more indepth conversation about the candidate's experience, their role within the team, how the team works and their future tasks and responsbilities.

### Coding Challenge (Engineering)/ Assignment (Non-Engineering): 3rd stage 

- For Non-engineering roles, candidates will usually be asked to complete an assignment or case study. In some cases this may be presented to members of the team in an interview.

- Every developer who passes the first interview should complete a coding challenge remotely.

- The coding challenge is currently available in Go, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, C++, Scala and Java. Other languages can be requested and we will consider the possibility of adding them. Candidates should complete the challenge in the language they feel most comfortable with.

- Unit tests are provided to validate the correctness of the solution.

- The time limit for solving the coding challenge is 5 hours. Completion in one hour is possible but it is very exceptional.

- We are expecting the solution either in a private Gist or in an attached file.

- The main point being reviewed is the correctness of the solution, however we do check the complexity and code style.

- For the Machine Learning team, there is an additional ML task that needs to be solved in the time limit of 5 hours. 

- The results are reviewed by the engineering team and feedback is given to the developer as soon as possible.

### Final Round of Interviews

- Non-engineering candidates who pass the third stage of the process will be invited to a final interview with various members of management which will be remote.

- Every developer who successfully solves the coding challenge is invited to the remaining interviews to a final stage of interviews either at our offices in Madrid, or remotely.

- It might last a full day or be split across two consecutive half-days, depending on the availability of the developer.

- This is the last step during which it's decided if the developer will receive an offer or not.

The interviews consist of the following:

- Kickoff with VP of Engineering (60min): to get to know the developer better.

- Design interview (90min): to see how the developer would design a solution to a given technical problem working with several of our engineers.

* Q&A (60min): to get to know the developer better. Two interviewers should participate; one from the team that the developer is being interviewed for, and one from any other engineering or non-engineering team (eg. Product, Talent).

- Logical thinking (60min): to see how the developer solves an abstract problem in a logical way.

- In the case of rejection, the candidate will be notified in the following days after the interview. This will be a constructive discussion giving the candidate as much insight as possible. 

### Offer

- The offer is sent by our CTO or Talent Acquisition Manager once a decision to hire has been made by the team

- The candidate has no concrete time deadline to accept/reject the offer, and we are happy to have another call to discuss any questions or doubts the candidate may have. In cases where we have a limited number of open positions for a role, and a larger number of people we'd like to make an offer to, a time limit is given.

### Diversity and Remote Working

- At source{d} we believe that amazing talent should not be constrained by physical barriers, and we exhaust all avenues to hire the best candidates regardless of their location. Our multinational and multicultural team shares a culture of openness and excellence and passion for programming.

- At the moment, we have more than 35 people from 10 different countries working closely together from our office in Madrid (Spain) and across Europe & the USA. We are more than happy to help with Visa sponsorship and guide you and your family through the whole process if you decide to come to work from our Madrid office. Currently, we have remote team members in USA, Portugal, Ireland, France, Belgium, Poland, Estonia and Russia.

- The local timezone of candidates who want to work remotely should be between San Francisco and Moscow.

- In specific cases, such as sales roles covering a particular region, there may be a requirement
