# Lou Marvin Caraig

**General**
- What's your name? How do your friends call you?
  - Lou Marvin Caraig - my friends just call me Marvin
- When were you born?
  - June 10, 1990
- Where are you from? Where have you lived?
  - I'm from Scandicci, Italy which is just ~10km from the centre of Florence. I relocated 4 years ago when my daughter was 1. Before that I was living nearer to the city centre of Florence. Anyway as you may notice I'm not the classical Italian guy, but I'm clearly Asian :). That's because my parents are from the Philipinnes and they came here in Florence in 1987.
- What languages (natural and programming ones) do you know?
  - natural: Italian, English (not as good as I'd like to be), Tagalog
  - programming: mainly Python, Scala, Javascript, then some experience with Java and R.

**Work**
- What are you going to be doing at source{d}?
  - I'll be part of the Applications Team
- Why did you join source{d}?
  - for different reasons:
    1. remote-friendly: which means higher flexibility, diversity due to international team, better life-work balance
    2. open-source core + open source days: :heart:
    3. coworkers: amazing people both professionaly, and now I can also say personally
- Where will you work from?
  - I'll work remotely from home
- If you could only save one programming language, which one would it be?
  - Python: easy to read, easy to learn, full-optional standard library, amazing 3rd party libraries (yeah I know some of them are actually built on top of C...)
- If you wanted to do an investment, what company would you choose?
  - This is a tough question... On the spot I think that I'd look for startups in the healthcare industry, in particular those that are trying to apply computer vision for diagnostic purposes, and also for startups in the transportation industry, as reducing the travelling time from different part of the world could be revolutionary.

**Other**
- What are your hobbies and what do you like about them?
  - I used to play a lot of basketball and I like it because some plays can be really spectacular, it requires team play, it can be highly phisical, it can be played on the streets. I also used to play go. I think that it's fascinating because the rules are very simple, but it's a very strategic board game. Nowdays I'm more boring and usually do machine learning related side-projects.
- What was the last lie you told?
  - Most probably the last one was telling to my daughter to behave, as otherwise Santa will not come.
- What was your first thought when you woke up this morning?
  - Oh s**t! I just slept few hours and I'm so sleepy right now! And I even have the flight to go back home!
- What question do you hate to answer?
  - This could be a candidate :joy:
- Whatâ€™s your favorite knock-knock joke?
  - I'm not very good in knock-knock jokes, but here's one: "A man enters in a coffee... SPLASH!"
- If you could have a coffee with any person in the world, who would it be?
  - That's another tough question, I actually never thought about this scenario. I need to think about it much more in order to don't waste this opportunity :)
- Would you like to share with us a story about yourself?
  - There's nothing in particular that I can think about now.
- What food do you like and dislike?
  - I like almost any Italian food and sushi. I don't love vegetables, and I'm usually too lazy to peel most of the fruits (luckily bananas exist).
- What is your favorite quote?
  - "Good, better, best. Never let it rest, until good is better, and better is best."
