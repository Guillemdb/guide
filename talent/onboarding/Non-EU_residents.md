# Candidates from Outside the European Union

This is the hardest process and we need approval from the Spanish Government. We have to get a work permit and a visa in the candidate's passport. The first goal, the work permit, is the responsibility of the Company and the process must take place in Spain. The second goal, the visa in the passport, is the responsibility of the candidate and must take place in the Spanish Consulate in the country where the candidate is living.


## Work Permit

We will need the following documents:

1. From the candidate side:

    * Passport: All pages.
    * CV/Resume: in Spanish.
    * Reference letters: in Spanish.
    * Diploma/Studies certificate: in Spanish (sworn translation). Sometimes we need the diploma with the Haya Apostille.

2. From the company side:

    * The same for every candidate
      - source{d} CIF.
      - Jorge’s ID
      - Strategy area: Certificate.
      - Power of attorney.
      - Resident authorization.

    * Different for every candidate
      - Paloma’s authorization.
      - Work contract: Draft.
      - Business activity.
      - Project memory.
      - Job profile.

When we have all the documents ready, the lawyer will present them to the government. The government has 20 business days to decide if the application is good or not. If so, the government gives us the “work permit” with a NIE number.


## Visa in the Passport

Depending on the country of origin, the candidate may require different documentation:

  1. Filled application form with photo: The consulate provides this to the candidate.
  2. Passport.
  3. ID from the country of origin.
  4. Job Offer with salary indication.
  5. Criminal records certificate with Apostille from every country where you have lived in the last 5 years.
  6. Work permit. This document we will obtain from the Spanish Government.

Usually, the Consulate requires 10 business days to process a visa application.


## Arriving in Spain

Once the candidate gets the visa, they are ready to travel to Spain. Upon arrival at the airport, they must get an entry stamp in their passport.

The lawyer will arrange an appointment with the police to record fingerprints, in order to get a resident card. After the appointment, it takes around 3 weeks to generate the resident card. The resident card is valid for two years.

To begin work, the candidates needs a social security number, meaning that we begin with the same steps that we need to do with EU residents.


### Social Security Number:

You have to go to the Social Security Office, Calle de Juan Bravo, 49 (without an appointment) and ask for “Número de afiliado”. Usually you have to wait around 1 hour.

You will need:

  * NIE document: Work permit.
  * Form NAF.
  * They may ask for your ID or passport (the NIE doesn’t include photo, sometimes they need to verify your identity).


## Candidates with Family

We are going to need more documents from the candidate side:

  1. Passport (all pages): Wife/husband.
  2. Marriage certificate: Wife/husband (in Spanish).
  3. Passport (all pages): All children.
  4. Birth certificate: All children (in Spanish).

Once the family receives a visa, they are ready to travel to Spain. Upon arrival at the airport, they must get entry stamps in their passports.
Usually, we manage all the visas needed at the same time.
